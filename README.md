# mushrooms-data-mining-
The data set being analysed has interesting information about different types of mushrooms, mostly consisting of their physical features like cap colour and cap shape for a better understanding of which ones are edible and which ones are poisonous.
The database containing all the information about the mushrooms can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification
Scikit-learing (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) was used to find out if a mushroom is poisonous or edible using;
1-Classification 
   The main objective is to predict the variables e (foe edible) and p (for poisonous) by identifying the main physical features in the poisonous mushrooms and the main physical features in the edible ones and classifying them using these features to better know which features to use when trying to identify mushrooms
2-Pattern Mining 
   It finds the best pattern and association files to better understand the information hidden in the data set. 
3-Clustering
